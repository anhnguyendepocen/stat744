	abstract = {Due to the high complexity of biological data it is difficult to disentangle cellular processes relying only on intuitive interpretation of measurements. A Systems Biology approach that combines quantitative experimental data with dynamic mathematical modeling promises to yield deeper insights into these processes. Nevertheless, with growing complexity and increasing amount of quantitative experimental data, building realistic and reliable mathematical models can become a challenging task: the quality of experimental data has to be assessed objectively, unknown model parameters need to be estimated from the experimental data, and numerical calculations need to be precise and efficient.Here, we discuss, compare and characterize the performance of computational methods throughout the process of quantitative dynamic modeling using two previously established examples, for which quantitative, dose- and time-resolved experimental data are available. In particular, we present an approach that allows to determine the quality of experimental data in an efficient, objective and automated manner. Using this approach data generated by different measurement techniques and even in single replicates can be reliably used for mathematical modeling. For the estimation of unknown model parameters, the performance of different optimization algorithms was compared systematically. Our results show that deterministic derivative-based optimization employing the sensitivity equations in combination with a multi-start strategy based on latin hypercube sampling outperforms the other methods by orders of magnitude in accuracy and speed. Finally, we investigated transformations that yield a more efficient parameterization of the model and therefore lead to a further enhancement in optimization performance. We provide a freely available open source software package that implements the algorithms and examples compared here.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm {(SSA)} and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale {SSA.}},

In this paper we show that the assumption of constant parameters in the model leads to quite unrealistic numerical values for these parameters. Moreover the reports published at the time show that plague epidemics in Bombay occurred in fact with a remarkable seasonal pattern every year since 1897 and at least until 1911. So the 1906 epidemic is clearly not a good example of epidemic stopping because the number of susceptible humans has decreased under a threshold, as suggested by Kermack and {McKendrick}, but an example of epidemic driven by seasonality. We present a seasonal model for the plague in Bombay and compute the type reproduction numbers associated with rats and fleas, thereby extending to periodic models the notion introduced by Roberts and Heesterbeek.},

  journal = {Ecology},

  volume = {87},
  pages = {1478-1488},
  abstract = {Applying the recent developments of scale transition theory, we demonstrate
	a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up local scale interactions
	to regional scale dynamics with field data. Dynamics on larger spatial
	scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because
	of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at
	the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental
	factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to
	scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model
	for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition
	theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial
	variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third,
	measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities
	at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine
	nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition.
	Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a
	freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce
	the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at
	the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the
	importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

  abstract = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied
	populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative
	importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past
	three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number
	of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population
	models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques
	both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models
	to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced
	that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these
	complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches.
	In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem
	of population cycles, using both long-term population time series
	and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology
	of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical
	models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles.
	Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate
	even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the
	remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent
	experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using
	modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time
	series generated by the models to the observed time series, using
	a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively
	as "probes." The model most similar to the data, as measured by these
	probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent
	the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this
	approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in
	which we know the "true" governing mechanism. Our analysis, which
	uses only a subset of the information available about the population,
	uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach
	might be successfully applied to field populations as well.},

  abstract = {The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic
	example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for Populations
	that exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological
	mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles;
	but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite
	conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated
	three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence:
	(1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation);
	(2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids),
	and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance
	of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these
	hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic
	dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each
	model to three long-term Population time series in Britain that exhibit
	some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric bootstrap
	to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their
	goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three
	forests: at Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit
	equally well; at Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects
	models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit
	best. However, the best-fit parasitism models required that the parasitism
	rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle, greatly exceeding
	the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field.
	In contrast, the required variation in the observable maternal quality
	variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations.
	Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a
	much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location),
	the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal
	effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the
	constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality
	model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality
	model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in
	which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been
	supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidence.},

  abstract = {In many infectious diseases, an unknown fraction of infections produce
	symptoms mild enough to go unrecorded, a fact that can seriously
	compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is
	true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of
	the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from
	3 to 100. In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental
	aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been
	based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological
	consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model
	incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity,
	with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains
	50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's
	endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far
	higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived
	from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses
	have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir (free-living
	pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but
	that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results
	demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting
	the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods, which
	allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models
	incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality,
	process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible
	to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our
	experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with
	mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology
	of many infectious diseases.},

	The first is that historical epidemics show various `fieldmarks'
	of chaos, such as positive Lyapunov exponents. Second, phase portraits
	reconstructed from real-world epidemiological time series bear a
	striking resemblance to chaotic solutions obtained from certain epidemiological
	models. Both lines of evidence are subject to dispute: the algorithms
	used to look for the fieldmarks can be fooled by short, noisy time
	series, and the same fieldmarks can be generated by stochastic models
	in which there is demonstrably no chaos at all. In the present paper,
	we compare the predictive abilities of stochastic models with those
	of mechanistic scenarios that admit to chaotic solutions. The main
	results are as follows: (i) the mechanistic models outperform their
	stochastic counterparts; (ii) forecasting efficacy of the deterministic
	models is maximized by positing parameter values that induce chaotic
	behaviour; (iii) simple mechanistic models are equal if not superior
	to more detailed schemes that include age structure; and (iv) prediction
	accuracy for monthly notifications declines rapidly with time, so
	that, from a practical standpoint, the results are of little value.
	By way of contrast, next amplitude maps can successfully forecast
	successive changes in maximum incidence one or more years into the

The data cloning ({DC)} method is a new general technique that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} algorithms to compute maximum likelihood ({ML)} estimates along with their asymptotic variance estimates for hierarchical models. Despite its generality, the method has two inferential limitations. First, it only provides Wald-type confidence intervals, known to be inaccurate in small samples. Second, it only yields {ML} parameter estimates, but not the maximized likelihood values used for profile likelihood intervals, likelihood ratio hypothesis tests, and information-theoretic model selection. Here we describe how to overcome these inferential limitations with a computationally efficient method for calculating likelihood ratios via data cloning. The ability to calculate likelihood ratios allows one to do hypothesis tests, construct accurate confidence intervals and undertake information-based model selection with hierarchical models in a frequentist context. To demonstrate the use of these tools with complex ecological models, we reanalyze part of Gause's classic Paramecium data with state—space population models containing both environmental noise and sampling error. The analysis results include improved confidence intervals for parameters, a hypothesis test of laboratory replication, and a comparison of the Beverton-Holt and the Ricker growth forms based on a model selection index.},

The test is a likelihood ratio test based on a discrete time stochastic logistic model. The null hypothesis is that the population is undergoing stochastic exponential growth, stochastic exponential decline, or random walk. The distribution of the test statistic under both the null and alternate hypotheses is obtained through parametric bootstrapping. We document the power of the test with extensive simulations and show how some previous tests in the literature for density dependence suffer from either excessive Type I or excessive Type {II} error. The new test appears robust against sampling or measurement error in the observations. In fact, under certain types of error the power of the new test is actually increased. Example analyses of elk (Cervus elaphus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) data sets are provided. The model implies that density-dependent populations do not have a point equilibrium, but rather reach a stochastic equilibrium (stationary distribution of population abundance). The model and associated statistical methods have potentially important applications in conservation biology.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},
